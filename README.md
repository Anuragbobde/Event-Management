# Event-Management
Event Management System 
I used My SQL for this Project the steps are :
Create the database in My SQL
Give the name to database which is related with the project
To begin with the project first we have to write the database name [for Ex. use (databasename) without spacing in the name]
This name i have provided in another file also in the starting
So lets starts the project.
