# Event-Management
Event Management System 
I used My SQL for this Project the steps are :
1. Create the database in My SQL
2. Give the name to database which is related with the project
3. To begin with the project first we have to write the database name [for Ex. use (databasename) without spacing in the name]
4. This name i have provided in another file also in the starting
5. So lets starts the project.
